     * Epoch time converter, you may be confused that it tells you this time stamp represents 8:00
     * PM on September 19th local time, rather than September 20th. We're concerned with the GMT
     * date here though, which is correct, stating September 20th, 2016 at midnight.

     * As another example, if you are in Hong Kong and the day is September 20th, 2016 and it is

     * time converter, you won't get midnight for your local time zone. Just keep in mind that we
     * are just looking at the GMT date here.

     * This method will ALWAYS return the date at midnight (in GMT time) for the time zone you
     * are currently in. In other words, the GMT date will always represent your date.
